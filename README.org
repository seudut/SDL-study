Study notes and some sample code for SDL2 library (https://www.libsdl.org/).

* Setup SDL environment on Mac
There are three ways, I know, to setup SDL development enviornmrnt on Mac. Some of them are them
is similar to Linux.

- Install through =brew=
- Install from source code
- Install from the dmg file.

* How to use the sample code
Each =.c= file is an independent source file containing =main()= function. Using =make filename= to compile and
link the source =filename.c=. The executable file =filename.out= will be generated.

* Sample
** Creating window
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  #include <SDL2/SDL.h>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
  SDL_Quit();
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  SDL_CreateWindow()
  SDL_DestroyWindow()
#+END_SRC
